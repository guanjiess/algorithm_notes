### Hash Codes

In computer science, ==taking an object and converting it into some integer== is called "computing the **hash code** of the object". For instance, the hash code of "melt banana" is 839099497.



### Properties of Hash codes

> Hash codes have three necessary properties, which means a hash code must have these properties in order to be **valid**:
>
> 1. It must be an Integer
> 2. If we run `.hashCode()` on an object twice, it should return the **same** number
> 3. Two objects that are considered `.equal()` must have the same hash code.
